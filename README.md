```
2. Various parameters are listed in [makefile](/src/makefile), run commmand

```

Example command has been provided in the run.sh file.

Reults will be formed in the `results` folder, and model will be saved in `models` folder.

## Sample Dataset
A sample Cora graph is given in the data folder. The structure of input graph is as follows:
```
<Graph_name> //input to the model
    <test_set> 
        <1>...<n>
    <val_set> 
        <1>...<n>
    <train_set> 
        <1>...<n>
// Each folder in train/val/test set should have a graph.txt and graph_stats.txt. The number of required cuts can be modifited in the graph_stats file.
```
Also, to run on any new graph, you need to add the graph.txt and node_embedding.pt file in raw_data folder.
